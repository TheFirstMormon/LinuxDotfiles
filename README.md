# LinuxDotfiles
My Personal Dotfiles for my linux systems. Most of it Based from the EndeavourOS project. 
I use the bspwm git as a start for my dotfiles because of ease of source for polybar really. Prefered for arch-based systems, but the distro really don't all matter.
this what I use for my system so I mean... 

side note: Here is what I reccomend personally for anyone else who is minimally minded like me (sort of) 
1. I don't encourage PICOM or xcompmgr (unless your on intel or AMD GPU), I am on a NVIDIA card and picom makes games screen tears. and I am lazy to make a config to make it where it quits when I play games. 
(You could just killall picom playing games also. I do that now.) 
2. Rofi - I recomend rofi and the theme I just find nord themes I can find here on gitub.
3. GTK Theme: I just stick to materia-dark and ePapirusDark for icons for my theming. Or Nord themes here on github. 

Personal Tip: Use lxappearance for GTK theming on bspwm. I don't know why that works and not xfce4-settings, but it does. 
Also, if you find some wallpapers y'all like that may go with this sort of theming, I would like to see them, I highly doubt this will be a large dotfile, but it would be cool anyways. I am not a big ricer at heart,
but I hope at least there is some some sort of inspiration. Happy Ricing!

Update 10/16/2023: I will be adding nord theming styles as the linux dotfiles.
